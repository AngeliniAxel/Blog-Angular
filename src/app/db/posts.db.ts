    title: 'The Evolution of Batman in Comics and Movies',
    text: `Batman has been a key figure in the comic book industry for decades. 
    From the dark and gritty stories of Frank Miller to the lighter animated series of the 90s, the character has seen numerous adaptations. 
    In film, Tim Burton’s gothic vision in the 80s gave way to Christopher Nolan’s realistic and grounded approach in the Dark Knight trilogy. 
    This constant reinvention is what makes Batman one of the most fascinating characters in pop culture. 
    The ability to evolve while maintaining core elements like the Bat-Signal, Gotham City, and the relationship with characters like Alfred and Commissioner Gordon 
    ensures that Batman remains relevant across different media and generations.`,

    While many tourists flock to Shibuya and Shinjuku, the true charm of Tokyo lies in its hidden alleys and quiet temples. 
    Try exploring Yanaka for a taste of old Tokyo, where narrow streets and traditional wooden houses transport you to another era.
